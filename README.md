# Project - CMon

This project came about as a need to make coordinating and managing money contribution of a group to be easy, seamless and well accounted for.

# Issue - Why this project?

I intend to solve this problem for my mum who occasionally has trouble keeping track of money given to her by the payer - some of which don't actually pay on time, owe 1 or more consecutive payments, the list goes on. However, the more pressing issue is when the collector is due to collect his/her money, sometimes the money is half-payed or remains 30% to be payed.

# Solution

- The aim is to solve the above listed problems
- Make the payment process to be transparent
- Integrate payment platform (e.g stripe, payStack e.t.c) into the project
- Integrate chat room functionality
